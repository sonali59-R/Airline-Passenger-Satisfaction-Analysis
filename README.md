# ✈ Airline Passenger Satisfaction Dashboard - Power BI

This project is based on a real-world business case from **Maven Analytics**,
where the objective is to analyze airline passenger satisfaction and identify key drivers behind satisfaction and dissatisfaction.


##  Project Overview

The goal of this dashboard is to help the airline company understand:

- What percentage of passengers are satisfied?
- How satisfaction varies by customer type, travel type, and class.
- Which customer profiles tend to return more often.
- What service factors contribute most to satisfaction or dissatisfaction.
- Whether flight distance or delays influence customer perception.


##  Tools & Skills Used

- **Power BI**
- **Data Modeling** (Unpivoting service ratings)
- **DAX Measures** (`CALCULATE`, `DIVIDE`, dynamic %)
- **Data Cleaning**
- **Business Intelligence & Storytelling**

##  My Learning Process

- This project is inspired by the **Maven Analytics challenge**.
- I downloaded the raw dataset and followed the business questions provided.
- I built the entire Power BI model from scratch:
  - Cleaned and transformed the data (including unpivoting 12+ service rating columns)
  - Built reusable and dynamic DAX measures
  - Designed an interactive, user-friendly dashboard
- I interpreted the results on my own to answer business questions in a clear, visual way.
